  <p class="faq-question">
Where does the name krapyDNA come from and what does it mean?</p>
  <p>
krapyDNA
was a meaningless nickname discovered in middle school when I spelled
my name, Andy Park, backwards. The meaning and purpose of the name
has developed into one of inspiration and  hope. Even though we are
sinful by nature and have “krapy” DNA, we are not restricted or
limited because true strength comes from Christ. With this strength,
krapyDNA believes that ordinary people can make an extraordinary
impact on the world.</p>
  <p class="faq-question">
How and when do you release new products?</p>
  <p>Most of the products will be released in collections. Each collection will have a specific theme and cohesiveness to it. Many companies release these collections in a seasonal format but krapyDNA will release them randomly as ideas for new themes come up. Sign up to our newsletter to stay updated with all new releases!</p>
  <p class="faq-question">
Will you restock or reprint shirts that are sold out?</p>
  <p>Only in rare cases will a shirt be restocked or reprinted. The overall movement
and direction of krapyDNA will be from collection to collection,
so once a shirt from an older collection is sold out, it will not be
restocked.</p>

  <p class="faq-question">
What type of shirts do you print on?</p>
  <p>
All krapyDNA shirts are printed on 100% soft ring-spun cotton from American Apparel and are 100% manufactured and printed in the USA. The shirts shrink a little after being washed so if you are between sizes, we recommend going with the larger one. When washing, we recommend that you flip your shirt inside out, wash cold, and hang dry. </p>
