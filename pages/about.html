<p><b>Story</b></p>
<div>

  <p><span>It
all started with God.</span></p>

  <p><span>He
placed in me a small idea to start a Christian clothing brand. Why me? I’m not
a designer and I’m not a businessman. Yet this idea developed into a full time
vision and calling.</span></p>

  <p><span>That
was early 2010. I was four years out of college and working in the
Pharmaceutical Industry. During that time, I was slowly developing a deeper
desire and burden to support the church of Christ and its body in a big way…
but I had no idea how. As I prayed and looked to God for guidance, the idea
formed and along with it, a vision.</span></p>

  <p><i><span>krapyDNA's
vision is to glorify God by faithfully serving the Church of Christ and its
body, and to inspire Christians to use their God given strengths to impact this
world.</span></i></p>

  <p><span>Even
though the vision was clear, the method and means to living it out was hazy. I
had none of the credentials to run a clothing brand and I was still busy
working full time and juggling the rest of my life. As I remained patient and
trusting in the Lord, He placed in me idea number two - "Quit your
job".</span></p>

  <p><span>This
idea was much more intimidating than the first. To make things even more
interesting, I was about to be offered a promotion. A thousand thoughts
cluttered my mind, but confirmation after confirmation piled up in front of me
as the path I had to take became clearer.</span></p>

  <p><span>It
just so happened that the Monday I planned on submitting my two week notice was
the same day I was officially offered a promotion. Before I even had a chance
to tell my manager, the HR rep called me down to her office. As I opened her
door and walked in, the first thing I saw was this big smile on her face like
she was about to hook me up.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

  <p><span>She
sat me down, and slid an offer to me across the desk. Apprehensively, I left
that piece of paper on the desk, and slid back my two week notice instead.</span></p>

  <p><span>And
that was it, the point of no return. My heart dropped a few inches when I
realized my life would never be the same. It was like the scene out of Back to
the Future - my space time continuum had shifted and a new path was paved for
me to follow.</span></p>

  <p><span>Now
what?</span></p>

  <p><span>Since
that day, it's been an extremely exciting, yet humbling and challenging
process. I don't have a formal business plan or any investors, but God is
clearly showing me that He is in the one in control and He is the one that
opens the doors to keep this going. As a result, my brand values are very
personal and dear to me. If you want to learn more about these values, check
