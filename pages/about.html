It was early 2010. I was four years out of college and working in the pharmaceutical industry. I found the corporate life to be very routine and unfulfilling, and it was during that time that I developed a burden to support the church and the body of Christ in a big way… but I had no idea how. </p>

<p>
It was then that God placed in me an idea to start a Christian clothing brand. Why me? I’m not a designer, and I don’t have much business experience. I clearly lacked the credentials to run a clothing brand and I was still busy working full-time. I was torn and struggled with this for over half a year. A part of me genuinely wanted to brainstorm and come up with ways to bring this to life, while another part of me was filled with doubt and hesitation. As I tried to remain patient and trusting in the Lord, I realized why this was where God was leading me. If any kind of success came my way, it’d be much easier to give God the glory than take it for myself. It was after this realization that He placed a second idea in me - <strong>"Quit your job."</strong>
</p>

<p>
This idea was ten times more intrusive than the first. My job may have been unfulfilling but it was comfortable, and on top of that, I was about to be offered a promotion. Amidst the doubts, confirmation after confirmation came and God made it clear that there was no other choice.
</p>

<p>
It just so happened that the Monday I planned on submitting my two-week notice was the same day I was officially offered a promotion. Before I even had a chance to tell my manager, the HR rep called me down to her office. As I opened the door and walked in, the first thing I saw was a big smile on her face.
</p>

<p>
She sat me down, and slid me an offer across the desk. With much apprehension, I left that piece of paper on the desk, and slid back my two-week notice instead.
</p>

<p>
<strong>It was the point of no return.</strong>
</p>

<p>
The following week was one of the toughest of my life. It was filled with doubts, sleepless nights and regrets. How would I live with no income? How was I going to find a designer? How am I possibly going to make this work? After the initial intensity of these questions subsided, I felt the kind of peace that only comes from God. I remembered how clearly He spoke through all the confirmations, and trusted that when you jump into deep waters, it’s God who pulls you out.
</p>

<p>
With work and most of my doubts behind me, I now had time to contemplate what God's will was for my life. As I reflected on my own experiences and how God led me away from my job, I realized that all I really wanted to do was share a message, one that isn't necessarily the gospel message that Christ died for us (which I fully believe) but a more specific one that is very personal in nature.
</p>

<p id="mission">
krapyDNA's mission is to share the message that God can use ordinary people to make an extraordinary impact on the world.

<p>
I don't have any exceptional skills or talents but trust that God can use me because it is through His strength that extraordinary things are done and not my own. And that is where this company comes into play. It is a medium for me to share this message and a medium for God to work.
</p>
<p>
I want my clothing and the designs on them to have more of a subtle and thought provoking look than an explicit one. My first collection called “The Creation” is just ground work for future collections and messages that I want to share and the designs reflect that.
</p>
<p>
In addition, my blog will be used to give you a glimpse into what it's like running a clothing brand, but more importantly it will be updated with interviews, stories and anything else related to how God uses people in the world today.
</p>
<p>
My vision for the future goes back to my burdens before this idea even came about. I want to be put in a position where I can support the local and global church and body of Christ in a big way. One specific area that has been placed on my heart is an orphanage in Andong, South Korea that my church, Grace Community Chapel, has been partnering with for the last four years. After building a relationship with the orphans, it became very apparent that most of them grow up without dreams or the belief that they can do great things. I hope to be able to show them that with God's strength, anything is possible.
</p>
<p> This company is my way of making an extraordinary impact and hopefully it inspires you to do the same.</p>
