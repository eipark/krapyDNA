It
started with a small but ambitious idea– start a Christian
clothing brand.</p>
  <p>
I
was 4 years out of college and working in the Pharmaceutical industry
when I found myself searching for a bigger vision, a bigger way to
impact this world. It was then that this idea came, but how to live
it out was the real dilemma. Working full time and balancing other
things in my life didn't give me much time to brainstorm and business
plan, and it was then that the 2<sup>nd</sup> idea came – quit your
job. This idea was much more intimidating than the first, and to
makes things even more interesting, I was about to be offered a
promotion at my company. The idea and the visions that came with it
ultimately overpowered my new position and pay raise though, and I
ended up putting my two week notice in on the same day they
officially offered me the promotion.</p>
  <p>
I
jumped into deep waters.</p>
  <p>
I
had plenty of time now to brainstorm and think about what I really
wanted to do and slowly things started to materialize. As I reflected
on my own experience and how God led me away from my corporate job, I
realized that all I really wanted to do through this company was to
share a message and that became my new mission.</p>
  <p>
krapyDNA's
mission is to share the message that God can use ordinary people to
make an extraordinary impact on the world.</p>
  <p>
I
don't really have many credentials to be running a clothing brand but
as I took the leap of faith, doors started to open one by one and I
gained confidence not in myself but in the power behind me. It was
then that it clicked that my company name had to be krapyDNA. Who
would've thought that a meaningless nickname discovered when I
spelled my name backwards in middle school would eventually come to
mean something so much more? I saw that despite my sinful nature and
my “krapy” DNA, God could still use me and use me in a big way.</p>
  <p>
This
company is my way of making extraordinary impact and my way of
telling you that you can too.</p>
